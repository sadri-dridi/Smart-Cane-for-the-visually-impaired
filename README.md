# Smart-Cane-for-the-visually-impaired
Implemented 3 ultra-sonic sensors aiming in front, at the right, and at the left side of the cane to help detect obstacles around and from a 1.5m distance.  Connected a metronome to the distance to make it inversely proportional (the closer the obstacle, the faster the bpm of the metronome)
