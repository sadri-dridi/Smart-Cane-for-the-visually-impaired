# Smart-Cane-for-the-visually-impaired
Implemented 3 ultra-sonic sensors aiming in front, at the right, and at the left side of the cane to help detect obstacles around and from a 1.5m distance.  Connected a metronome to the distance to make it inversely proportional (the closer the obstacle, the faster the bpm of the metronome).

to create a smart cane for the visually impaired using three ultrasonic sensors:

1 - Initialize the three ultrasonic sensors and calibrate them to ensure they are all properly functioning.

2 - Continuously poll the sensors to measure the distance to any nearby objects.

3 - Use the measurements from the three sensors to triangulate the position of any nearby objects in relation to the user.

4 - If an object is detected within a certain distance of the user (e.g. within arm's reach), use the ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance to the object in order to determine its relative size and shape.

5 - Use this information to provide haptic feedback to the user, such as vibrating the cane when an object is detected within a certain distance, or using different patterns of vibration to indicate the size and shape of the object.

6 - Additionally, the smart cane could use voice output to provide further information to the user, such as announcing the distance and relative location of nearby objects.

Here is some sample Python code for implementing this algorithm.


This is one possible way to implement a smart cane for the visually impaired using three ultrasonic sensors. There are many other potential approaches and variations that could be used depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
